\# ⚠️ Notice About Forks

Forks of this project may contain altered rule sets, corrupted JSON models, modified modules, or Python scripts that run arbitrary code.  

They are not reviewed or verified. Only use the official version and load or execute models and scripts from trusted sources.  

In the future, an official model and module store may provide a safe, verified source for additional content.
