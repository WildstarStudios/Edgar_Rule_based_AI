a rule based ai currently in hardcoded data phase

older models will be free but newer ones may not be available for free for testing reasons. older models are better tested and are known to preform stabily. newers ones will need more testing.
though this doesnt stop you from training your own models using this code or current free models.

currently working on the ui and training system.


after iniitial code is finished it may not need much more code after. only updates to improve matching systems.
